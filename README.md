# Introduction to Programming

This repository contains C programs for two different tasks:

1. **Average Marks Calculation**: This program calculates the average marks of a student in three subjects: Physics, Chemistry, and Math. For each subject, four different tests are conducted: Assignment, Coursework, Mid-term, and End-of-term exams.

2. **Animals Grouping**: This program accepts two groups of animals: domestic animals and wild animals. After entering each group, the program prints the combined list of all animals.

- Basic understanding of C programming concepts.

## Usage

### 1. Average Marks Calculation

This program takes input for marks from four tests (Assignment, Coursework, Mid-term, and End-of-term) for three subjects: Physics, Chemistry, and Math. It then calculates the average score for each subject and displays the overall average score.

### 2. Animals Grouping

This program allows the user to enter two groups of animals:
- **N domestic animals**
- **X wild animals**

The program will output the combined list of domestic and wild animals.
